# EduQuizAI 

This is the *frontend* part of EduQuizAI, a project initially built during a college hackathon. The platform is designed to allow students to upload their notes and automatically generate quizzes using AI (to be implemented). 

This repo contains the *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript* UI I developed during the event.

## 🏁 Hackathon Journey
